# Classification of Breast Abnormalities on Mammography by Convolutional Neural Network Backpropagation (Numpy Scratch)

## Abstract
The epidemiologic transition in Indonesia is occurring due to a significant increase in cases of non-communicable diseases, while infectious diseases are increasingly neglected, one of which is the increase in breast cancer cases. In 2020, GLOBOCAN explained that there were 68,858 new cases of breast cancer (16.6%) out of a total of 396,914 new cases of cancer in Indonesia. Breast cancer detection techniques can be done by medical detection through a series of laboratory tests. However, breast tumors can be difficult to detect, such as no lumps felt during physical tests or seen on screening mammograms. In the problem of classification of breast abnormalities in mammography images, it can be solved effectively using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Backpropagation algorithm. CNN is an algorithm that aims to extract features in image data and optimize parameters in the model so that predictions become more accurate.

## Limitation
Instead of using TensorFlow Framework to build CNN model, I was using only numpy library to understand the flow of backpropagation algorithm more deeply in mathematics field.

## Purpose
1. Made as one of requirements to get bachelor degree of Mathematics study program in Universitas Airlangga
2. Applying Convolutional Neural Network Backpropagation for the classification of breast abnormalities in mammographic image data.
3. Create a program to perform feature extraction from mammography image data mammography image data of breast cancer using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
4. Implementing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) program with Backpropagation technique for breast abnormality classification on mammography image data.
